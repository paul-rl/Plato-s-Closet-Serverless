For querying message
Need to:
1. Add query message
2. Send query result back to client
3. Convert query to csv in client side


Functionality to test:
1. Export csv
2. Change text message (Ask about emojis again)
3. Register to db
4. Send text to unverified phone number
5. Send message from client to server:
    a. disconnect
    b. sendText
    c. query
    d. 

Things still to implement:
1. Message queue to avoid concurrent r/w to db
2. Fixup UI, A LOT
3. Password implementation
